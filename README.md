Arduino Blender Controller Linker

Arduino Blender Controller Build a hardware modular controller to connect to Blender via serial or MIDI through Arduino. This is my first electronics and programming project. The idea behind the project is to connect and control Blender functions and parameters to a physical controller to record animations or to animate the scene in real-time.
